# T2T-Assembly Visualization

This project extends [QUAST](https://github.com/ablab/quast) and its Icarus module to improve visualization of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assemblies, particularly for evaluating haplotype-resolved assemblies against complete reference genomes like T2T-CHM13.

## Features

• **Block merging**: Combines nearby alignment blocks
• **Alignment filtering**: Excludes short alignments (< 1,000 bp)  
• **Centromere handling**: Aggregates centromeric alignments into unified blocks  
• **Interactive ideogram**: Unified HTML visualization of all chromosomes  
• **Haplotype comparison**: Supports evaluation of two haplotypes against a reference  


## Example Visualizations
